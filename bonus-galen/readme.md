This is rather different from the rest of the code on this repository.

Majority of the testing code used here is using Applitools, Selenium WebDriver and BrowserStack. This one right here is a gspec used for testing website using Galen Framework.

This code is underdeveloped as the effort to write tests is too much to create meaningful results compared to simply using Selenium WebDriver.
